# End-to-end-Heart-disease-machine-learning-project


This notebook looks into using various python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

We're going to take the following approach:

    Problem defenition
    Data
    Evaluation
    Features
    Modelling
    Experimentation
